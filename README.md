This repository contains all user-facing code required to render [living-wage.co.za](http://living-wage.co.za/). Initially developed by [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/). However, project is now maintained on a volunteer basis by the [Codebridge Newlands community](https://www.facebook.com/codebridge.newlands/).

## Introduction
A wage that is an income that is high enough to maintain a "normal standard of living". A normal standard of living refers to the level of wealth, comfort, material goods, and necessities available to a certain socio-economic class in a certain geographic area, usually a country.
Cost of living is the amount of money needed to sustain a certain level of living, including basic expenses such as housing, food, taxes and health care. A cost-of-living index is a theoretical price index that measures relative cost of living over time or regions. It is an index that measures differences in the price of goods and services, and allows for substitutions with other items as prices vary.

The purpose of this calculator is to assist the user to determine a realistic wage, initially within the context of a domestic worker, which is influenced by factors such as transport, children, education, food, housing, etc.
